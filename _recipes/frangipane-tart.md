# Asparagus and tomato savoury frangipane tart


1. Heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5 and put a baking sheet in the oven to heat. Roll the puff pastry on a lightly floured worksurface into a rectangle measuring 40cm x 25cm. Fold over 2cm of the pastry from around the edges to create a border. Carefully lift onto a second baking-paper-lined baking sheet and chill.

2. To make the frangipane, put the softened butter into a bowl and use electric beaters to whip until light and fluffy. Add the garlic then the whole eggs, one at a time, adding a large spoonful of flour with each egg. Add any remaining flour, the ground almonds and parmesan, and mix well.

3. Dot all over the inside of the tart then use a palette knife to spread evenly. Scatter over the asparagus, cherry tomatoes and thyme. Mix the egg yolk with 1 tsp of water and brush the border well.

4. Place the cool baking sheet on top of the hot baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes  or until the pastry is crisp, the frangipane is puffed and golden, and the asparagus and tomatoes are cooked. Drizzle generously with extra-virgin olive oil and serve.
